## Project Desafio-Taqtile

Here I will talk about what I'll be developing in the next few days.

## ðŸ§ª Environment and tools

This project will be developed with the following technologies:
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)
- [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/pt) version v20.11.0
- [Git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git) e [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
- [Eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)

## ðŸ’» Run and debug

Clone the project and access its folder.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eduardacalado/desafio-taqtile

$ cd desafio-taqtile
```

To install and inicialize the project follow the steps:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install 
or
$ npm install 
# To inicialize the project
$ yarn dev
or 
$ npm run dev
```
**For debugging:**

- Select Run and Debug from the Debug start view in the left sidebar.
-  To customize the Run and Debug view, create a ```launch.json``` file by clicking "create a launch.json file" when prompted. Modify the ```launch.json``` file as needed to suit your project.
-  Switch back to the File Explorer view, and you'll see that VS Code has created a ```.vscode``` folder. The ```launch.json``` file will be inside this folder, already added to your workspace.
-  Click in the margin next to the line numbers in your code to set breakpoints where you want to pause execution.
-   In the Debug panel click the green Start Debugging button to start debugging.   

Follow these steps to inspect variables, monitor execution, and debug your application effectively.
